# Graham Roten Enterprises Website

This repository hosts the static website for **Graham Roten Enterprises** located in Boone, NC. The site is designed for deployment to GitHub Pages and uses plain HTML, CSS and a small amount of JavaScript.

## Development

To view the site locally, simply open `index.html` in your browser. Edits to styling can be made in `style.css` and interactive behavior is located in `script.js`.

## Deployment

GitHub Actions is configured to automatically deploy the contents of the `main` branch to GitHub Pages. Any pushes to `main` will trigger a deployment.

## Future Work

A company logo will be added in a future update. The current site uses a text placeholder for the logo.
